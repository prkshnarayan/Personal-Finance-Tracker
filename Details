## This project is related to the Personal Finance Tracker project.


## Features:
Tracking the finance like income, expenses, and balance
Instant updating of balance after updating/adding the record(transaction).
User friendly and user experience.


## Technologies used:
---Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django framework, SQLite (database)


## Brief Explanation of the complete project:

---Django follows MVT/MVC pattern as M stands for Models(related to database tables), V stands for Views (related to the
 python logic connecting to the Models) and T stands for Templates (related to the user experience or used to present
 the data to the user)

---to add/save the data a Model named AddTransaction class is created.

---the input from the HTML forms are handled using the AddTransactionForm class in the forms.py.

---Created an app named Financeapp containing all the code related to adding transactions.

---The file Financeapp.urls are responsible for the url routing.

---In order to access the static files without any error the url and directory are to be mentioned in the
settings.py file as mentioned below:

        STATIC_URL = 'static/'
        STATICFILES_DIRS = [
            BASE_DIR / "static",
        ]
        STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / "staticfiles"


---All the static files (CSS, JS and images if necessary) are placed in a separate directory names static inside
the project.

---All the Templates are grouped in a templates directory (and add 'DIRS': ['templates'] in the templates dictionary of
settings.py file) inside the project and outside the app directory.

---The views.py has the logic of adding the transaction carefully using the POST method, as if the method is post it
takes the input from the user using AddTransactionForm and saves the record to the database. If the method id not
post it will be redirecting to the same page without adding the details to the database.

---After adding the transaction to the database successfully, using the filter method the details
(form (user input data), income, expense and balance) are accessed using ORM(Object Relational Mapping) and
sends the data to the HTML template using the context dictionary.

---The template display.html consists of user form input, summary (income, expense, balance), and also consists of
transaction details (like title, type, amount, category and date)
